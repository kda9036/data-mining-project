# Data Mining Project

RIT Fall 2022

Course: Data Mining and Exploration

# Project Description

The purpose of this project is to follow the process of going from data to knowledge using a data
set that applies to a real-world problem. For this project, you will form teams of 3 students,
where each team represents a fictitious data science consultancy firm. Your firm’s objective is to
locate a data set “provided to you” by a client (real or fictitious) in order to help solve the client’s
problem. This means that when locating a data set, you should be thinking about an impactful
problem that working with this data set would solve and what sort of company would be
interested in solving this problem. You may use any data mining software packages or libraries
you wish for performing data mining tasks and any programming language for cleaning and preprocessing
the data.
